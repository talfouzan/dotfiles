Mr. Thunayan Al Fouzan

I have been working out most of my adult life.  This all came to an end when I
suffered herniated discs in my back from lifting too much weight.  After the
injury I was going to doctors to see if they could fix me.  All the doctors
could not guarantee me a permament solution to my pain.  So I decided to try and
heal myself.  I did my physical therapy and slowly tried to get back into the
gym.  I inevitably reinjured myself and was bedridden for a few months.  For the
next 8 years, I started to hire trainers to see if with supervision I can get back into shape.
I have been dissapointed in all the trainers I tried in my life except two.  One
trainer who I worked with 10 years ago, and Bhoy at clubfit.

I was very sceptical at first, I was overweight and was suffering from a torn calf and a disc injury.I honestly thought that I was not going lose weight and will have to live with
pain all my life.  When I first met Bhoy he was attentive, knowledgable, and had experience working with injured people. Bhoy was very careful with me.  He created a program that helped me get flexibile and build strength in my
back and core.  The goal was to remove the pain and lose the weight.  Since I
have been on this program, I have lost weight, gained flexibility, and have reduced
my pain significantly. I honestly have found the trainer I want to work with the
rest of my life.  Thank you Clubfit.
